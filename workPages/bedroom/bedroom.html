        <p>This introduction assignment was the first one of the semester. I spent hours mulling over it, as I wasn't sure how to introduce myself into this honors English class. So, I stuck to what I knew, and wrote a little bit of freeform poetry, since the structure in the rubric for this assignment said we could be creative. I picked out parts of myself that I found significant, the parts that made me unique, and I wrote them all down for the world to see, before composing them into one of my favorite art forms. It was a little nerve wracking, since I didn't know anyone in this class at first, and I feared the rejection of others thinking I was pompous for writing a poem or oversharing on the first assignment. However, this fear was unfounded, as I came to find like minded friends in this class. Though more open-ended assignments like these were sometimes a bit of a hardship, I learned throughout the course how to use my own style to fill in the gaps that the rubrics left in my head. </p>

        <h2>Who I Am - Andrea Linder</h2>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>I am an experience. Perceived by others and myself as somewhat strange, sometimes a
            friendly one, sometimes not so much. I am the experience of my parents meeting by chance through a double
            blind
            date. I am all of the people I have met in life and conversed with. I am all of the places I have been, and
            all
            of the songs I have listened to. I am a brain, made of gray and white matter, sitting inside a skeleton
            controlling a nervous system to type this post out right now. I am the topics that I could scream about to
            the
            open sky, and I am the late nights spent whispering callouts into my microphone for my team in various
            inconsequential video games. I am constructed out of jokes, flimsy and fleeting. I am my maternal grandma's
            doppelganger, coincidentally looking almost exactly like her and being named after her. I am the middle
            child,
            the bookworm. I am the thrill seeker of the family. I've leapt from heights where others would falter, and
            I've
            suffered the consequences of poor decisions. I'm a student, forever learning and seeking more information. I
            am
            a lover of all animals, seeking to understand feelings and find new experiences to further enrich my life
            and
            theirs. I am a friend, a sibling, an heir. I am American, born and raised in Arizona, though my ancestors
            hail
            from England and Northern Europe. I am a future hopeful medical student, hoping to heal others. I am like a
            prop
            plane, sometimes needing a push before I can fly on my own. I am the tens of thousands of hugs that I have
            given
            and received over my lifetime. These things aren't just parts of my life, fragments of memories as they may
            seem, as they're all parts of me. I am Andrea.</p>
