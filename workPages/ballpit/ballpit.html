      <p>I am a successful person, despite the hardships I have been through. Despite the eating disorder, and despite my brain working a little differently than average, I am successful. I would say that the main reason for my success is my rationality, in my ability to put my future self in good positions so that I don't have to stress about it, and so I'll have a secured future in my grasp. The sugar high of temporary happiness will not lead to success in the long run, and so I must pursue a different kind of happiness, one formed not through short bursts of success, but through climbing the stairway of success, one step at a time, finding my own way to be happy while still on that path. My favorite quote from the semester that I wrote in my notebook is very relevant to this. "I'm on the path, but also kind of not. The only thing holding me back from doing anything is myself." This was in response to a free write started by Dr. Wisland, in which he questioned how we were doing, and if we were where we wanted to be on our paths to the future.

      <h2>Rationality with Conscience - Andrea Linder</h2>
      <br />
      <br />

        I'm autistic. This has been a rather big factor in most of the decisions
        in my life. When I was a young girl, I found myself constantly
        confronted with decisions that questioned my rock-hard resolve, which
        was hard when I was brought up by cartoons and books that had a clear
        antagonist and protagonist. The problem in life, though, is that there
        aren't generally defined protagonists and antagonists, other than seeing
        yourself as a protagonist in most things. Some people like to see
        themselves as the antagonist, but that's kind of besides the point?
        Emotions are really hard, as is balancing them with your beliefs.
        Sometimes you want something really badly, like, say, a piece of candy,
        but you know in your heart that you both don't want and shouldn't have
        that piece of candy. You don't need the calories. You have to convince
        yourself not to take the piece of candy, but it would just be so easy to
        do. It would be an immediate gratification, but that gratification
        wouldn't last. It couldn't last, because the sugar will dissolve in your
        mouth and then you'll be left with the aftertaste of something not quite
        as sweet as the candy but still a reminder of what you've done, and how
        it didn't last, nor did it fully fix the craving. The belief that it is
        right to do whatever you want is both incorrect and correct in a way,
        because no given belief is just genuinely correct. Just like how each
        person has their own beliefs, and has a certain amount of percentage
        that they're willing to bet on those beliefs being correct, there is a
        portion of society that simply disagrees with that person's fundamental
        beliefs. This denial is what changes the idea of “right” and “wrong”,
        considering those two terms do not exist in contemporary society. One
        can defend their beliefs, for sure, but they cannot say their thoughts
        are always in the right, because humans are biased innately. Humans can
        try their best to become unbiased, but life isn't that easy, and you can
        get close to being unbiased, but you'll never really get there. This is
        just long form for saying that people are biased and that they'll seek
        out whatever they want. The pursuit of happiness is just a pursuit of
        serotonin, and in that way is just another search for the next high,
        like an addict looking for their next hit.
