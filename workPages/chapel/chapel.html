      <p>I was raised Christian, and, as a result of the Sunday schools and holidays spent praying in church, I'm fairly well versed in the bible. I don't hold any faith currently, though the bible is still something I love to discuss. Intense debate is not something I'm fond of, however, since those tend to fall into irrationality and people will start to take the fact that you don't agree with them personally. I'll strongly debate the case of Trayvon Martin any day, however, since others seem to be justifying his death and saying that he deserved to die despite him being a literal child, one who didn't kill anyone else. This justification of death is clearly one meant to sate the guilt of those that would kill people of color for no valid reason other than the color of their skin and the differences of their culture. It is through this class, and through student learning outcome 1B “Explain the purposes of, intended audiences for, and arguments in a text and how these are impacted by particular cultural, economic, and political contexts.”, that I was able to complete assignments like this one, further able to understand why others would dare to kill a child over some faces he made in the mirror.</p>

      <h2>In Defense of Our Sins - Andrea Linder</h2>

       Sinful people do not deserve to die. This is my strongest belief, personally. People are not necessarily “born” bad, and if they are, it likely isn't their fault at all, but rather a genetic issue or emotional disorder. Of course, this does not mean that they aren't responsible for their own actions (at least in most cases though this could be a topic of debate easily.) As an avid viewer of true-crime, the vast majority of people that commit violent crimes are seriously disturbed people that need help or have needed help and have simply been failed by the system around them. This doesn't even begin to bring up the issue of people stealing necessities such as medications and food, which in my opinion is not a criminalizable offense, considering those things should be the rights of all people. I'm a firm believer that, no matter what, everyone has the right to live, and the right to die. This does not mean that they can choose to live in luxury, or that we should let those deep in depression die, but rather that people of sound mind should be allowed to choose their point of beginning and end. I find it interesting how easily people can be manipulated into believing that someone genuinely deserves death, and nothing else. Prison has become a punishment, in this country, rather than the rehabilitation facility that it should be, which is why the rate of re-offenders for American prisons is 76.6%. We also criminalize things such as drugs, which shouldn't be an issue of the law in general, but rather we should help addicts to become free of their vices. Most of all, we shouldn't try to JUSTIFY someone's death based on what they did in the past! A child, Trayvon Martin, died, and people attempt to justify his death because he took some silly pictures that any teenager could have taken? This simply doesn't make any sense! We've all done silly faces into the mirror as a child, and this generation of children does the same with the mirror within their phones. We make mistakes, as children, as adults, and as people. These do not undo our presence as human beings, and our right to live with our mistakes in tow.
